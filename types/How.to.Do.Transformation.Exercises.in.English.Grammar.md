- She is too young to drive. (not old enough)
- She is **not old enough** to drive.

Transformation exercises can help you improve your grammar skills and prepare for exams like Cambridge First or Advanced. Here are some tips on how to do them:

1. Read the instructions carefully and identify what kind of transformation you have to do. For example, you may have to change the tense, the voice, the word class, or the sentence type.
2. Look at the original sentence and the word given. Think of how you can use that word in the new sentence without changing the meaning.
3. Write the new sentence using the word given. Make sure you follow the rules of grammar and punctuation. Don't add or omit any words unless necessary.
4. Check your answer and compare it with the original sentence. Make sure they have the same meaning and that you have used the word correctly.

Here are some examples of transformation exercises with answers:

| Original sentence | Word given | New sentence |
| --- | --- | --- |

| I haven't seen him for ages. (last) | Last | The **last** time I saw him was ages ago. |

| He started working here three years ago. (for) | For | He has been working here **for** three years. |

| The teacher gave us some homework. (had) | Had | We **had** to do some homework. |

| I'm sorry I didn't call you earlier. (wish) | Wish | I **wish** I had called you earlier. |

| Someone stole my bike yesterday. (was) | Was | My bike **was** stolen yesterday. |

Transformation exercises can be divided into different types depending on the kind of change you have to make. Here are some common types of transformation exercises and how to do them:
 
## Changing the tense
 
Sometimes you have to change the tense of the sentence to express a different time or aspect. For example:

- She works in a bank. (present simple)
- She **is working** in a bank. (present continuous)

To change the tense, you have to know the rules of verb forms and how they are used. For example, the present simple is used for facts, habits, or general truths, while the present continuous is used for actions happening now or around now. You also have to pay attention to the subject and the verb agreement. For example:

- He **plays** tennis every weekend. (present simple)
- He **is playing** tennis right now. (present continuous)

## Changing the voice
 
Sometimes you have to change the voice of the sentence from active to passive or vice versa. For example:

- The dog bit the boy. (active)
- The boy **was bitten** by the dog. (passive)

To change the voice, you have to know how to form the passive voice with the verb to be and the past participle of the main verb. You also have to identify the subject, the object, and the agent of the action. For example:

- The police arrested the thief. (active)
- The thief **was arrested** by the police. (passive)

Sometimes you can omit the agent if it is not important or obvious. For example:

- Someone broke the window. (active)
- The window **was broken**. (passive)
