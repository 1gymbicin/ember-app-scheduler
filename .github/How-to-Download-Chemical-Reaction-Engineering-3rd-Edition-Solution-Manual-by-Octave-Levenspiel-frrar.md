Chemical reaction engineering is a specialty in chemical engineering or industrial chemistry that focuses on designing and optimizing chemical reactors, where either a homogeneous or heterogeneous catalyst is present[^3^]. Chemical reactors are devices that convert raw materials into desired products by controlling the rate and extent of chemical reactions. Chemical reaction engineering involves applying principles of mass and energy balance, thermodynamics, kinetics, transport phenomena, and reactor design to achieve the best performance of a reactor system.
 
The textbook **Chemical Reaction Engineering** by **Octave Levenspiel** covers the fundamentals of chemical reaction engineering, such as reaction rates, mole balances, conversion and selectivity, ideal reactors, multiple reactions, non-ideal reactors, residence time distribution, biochemical reactions, and reactor stability. The third edition of the book also includes new topics such as membrane reactors, fluidized bed reactors, microreactors, and nonlinear dynamics[^2^]. The book provides numerous examples and problems to help students learn how to answer reactor design questions reliably and effectively.
